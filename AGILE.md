## Project Management

SkillFlow's development follows a structured agile methodology, leveraging the MoSCoW prioritization framework to deliver maximum value efficiently. Our iterative approach ensures continuous delivery of functional increments while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.

GitHub Projects serves as our primary project management tool, providing a transparent Kanban board that visualizes workflow and progress.

Key principles guiding our agile implementation include:

- **User-Centric Development**: All features are evaluated based on user value
- **Iterative Delivery**: Small, frequent releases to gather feedback early
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular retrospectives to refine processes

This structured yet flexible approach ensures SkillFlow can deliver a high-quality platform that meets user needs while adapting to marketplace changes and technical challenges.

## User Stories

User stories form the foundation of our development process, breaking down complex requirements into manageable, user-focused features. Each story articulates value from the perspective of a specific user role, ensuring development remains aligned with actual user needs.

### User Story Template

All SkillFlow user stories follow a consistent format to ensure clarity and focus:


[US-X.X] Title

As a [user role], I want to [capability] so that [benefit/value].

Acceptance Criteria:
- Criteria 1
- Criteria 2
- Criteria 3

Tasks:
[ ] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
[ ] Task 3


This structured format ensures each story clearly communicates:
- The target user role (who)
- The desired functionality (what)
- The underlying motivation (why)
- Specific success criteria (verification)
- Implementation tasks (how)

### Prioritization

SkillFlow implements the MoSCoW prioritization framework to ensure development efforts focus on delivering maximum value. Each user story is classified according to one of four priority levels:

#### Must Have (M)
Features that are critical to the minimum viable product (MVP). Without these features, the platform would not function effectively or provide core value. Example: User authentication system, service listing creation, and basic booking capabilities.

**SkillFlow Must-Have Examples:**
- User registration and authentication
- Service listing creation and management
- Basic booking functionality
- User profile management
- Category-based service organization

#### Should Have (S)
Important features that significantly enhance the user experience but aren't absolutely critical for initial launch. These features are implemented after "Must Have" items and before lower-priority items.

**SkillFlow Should-Have Examples:**
- Availability management system
- Service editing capability
- Email confirmations for bookings
- Advanced search and filtering
- Mobile-responsive design

#### Could Have (C)
Desirable features that would improve the platform but could be deferred without significant impact to the core experience. These are implemented when resources permit after higher-priority items.

**SkillFlow Could-Have Examples:**
- Rating and review system
- Service provider verification
- Advanced analytics for service providers
- Social media sharing
- Enhanced profile customization

#### Won't Have (W)
Features that have been considered but explicitly excluded from the current development cycle. These may be reconsidered in future iterations based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

**SkillFlow Won't-Have Examples:**
- Real-time video consultation
- Integrated payment processing
- Mobile application (focusing on responsive web first)
- AI-powered service recommendations
- Subscription-based premium features

### Acceptance Criteria

Each user story includes specific acceptance criteria that define when a feature is considered complete. These criteria serve as verification points during development and testing, ensuring the implementation satisfies user requirements.

**Example Acceptance Criteria from SkillFlow:**

For user story [US-2.2] "Edit Job Listing":

```
Acceptance Criteria:
- Providers can access an edit form for their existing services
- All service details can be modified (title, description, category, hourly rate)
- Changes are saved and immediately reflected in service listings
- Only the service owner can edit their listings

Tasks:
[✓] Create edit form pre-populated with existing service data
[✓] Implement authorization checks to verify service ownership
[✓] Add validation for edited service details
[✓] Update database and UI to reflect changes
```

These detailed criteria eliminate ambiguity regarding feature completeness and provide clear guidance for development and testing activities.

## Epics

SkillFlow organizes related user stories into epics, which represent major functional areas of the platform. This hierarchical structure facilitates planning, tracking, and reporting at different levels of granularity.
